# Arabic Printing - Why It's Not Working & Solution

## The Problem

You mentioned Electron works fine for printing Arabic, but this Tauri app prints gibberish. Here's why:

### Electron (Your Working App)
- Uses **HTML/GDI printing**
- Windows renders Arabic text as **graphics/bitmaps**
- The printer receives **images**, not text characters
- Arabic rendering (shaping, RTL) is handled by Windows
- ✅ **Always works** because it's just printing images

### This Tauri App (Currently)
- Uses **RAW ESC/POS commands**
- Sends **raw text bytes** directly to printer
- Bypasses Windows rendering
- Requires printer to understand Arabic **character encoding**
- ❌ **Fails** if printer doesn't support the specific encoding

## Why RAW ESC/POS Fails for Arabic

1. **Character Encoding Mismatch**
   - Arabic has multiple encodings (UTF-8, Windows-1256, CP864, ISO-8859-6)
   - Each printer supports different code pages
   - We tried: UTF-8, Windows-1256, CP864 - none worked
   - Your NCR 7197 likely doesn't support ANY of these for Arabic

2. **No Right-to-Left Support**
   - Arabic reads right-to-left
   - ESC/POS printers don't have RTL commands
   - Characters print in wrong order

3. **Arabic Shaping**
   - Arabic letters change form based on position (isolated/initial/medial/final)
   - Printers don't do this shaping
   - Letters print disconnected

## The Solution

### Option 1: Use Windows GDI Printing (Like Electron) ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

Instead of RAW ESC/POS, use Windows' native printing which renders Arabic as graphics.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Arabic displays perfectly (just like Electron)
- ✅ No encoding issues
- ✅ Proper RTL and shaping
- ✅ Works on ALL printers

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower than RAW printing
- ❌ No precise ESC/POS control (cuts, beeps, etc.)
- ❌ Uses more resources

**Implementation:**
This requires using a different printing API that renders through Windows GDI instead of sending raw bytes. This would need a significant code change.

### Option 2: Use English Text Only

Simplest solution - print receipts in English/numbers only.

**Example:**
```
      SAMPLE STORE
   123 Main Street
 City, State 12345
Tel: (555) 123-4567

================================
Item          Qty    Price
================================
Apple          2x    $2.50
Banana         3x    $1.50
Orange         1x    $3.00
================================
SUBTOTAL:              $7.00
TAX (10%):             $0.70
TOTAL:                 $7.70

Thank you for your purchase!
```

### Option 3: Bitmap Arabic Text

Convert Arabic text to images and print as bitmaps using ESC/POS image commands.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Arabic displays correctly
- ✅ Keeps RAW ESC/POS speed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex implementation
- ❌ Requires image rendering library
- ❌ Larger data to send to printer

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1** - implementing Windows GDI printing like Electron uses.

This would require:
1. Creating a new Tauri command that uses Windows GDI
2. Rendering the receipt as formatted text through Windows
3. Letting Windows handle all Arabic rendering

This is exactly how Electron does it, which is why it works for you.

## Current Code Status

The current code (after all our attempts):
- ✅ Properly detects thermal printers
- ✅ Sends ESC/POS commands for formatting
- ✅ Sends UTF-8 Arabic text without code page conversion
- ❌ Still prints gibberish because printer doesn't understand Arabic encoding

## Next Steps - Your Choice

**Option A:** I can implement Windows GDI printing (significant work, but will work perfectly)

**Option B:** Switch to English-only receipts (quick, works immediately)

**Option C:** We can try manually configuring your NCR 7197 firmware for Arabic support (may not be possible)

**Option D:** Implement bitmap Arabic rendering (complex but keeps ESC/POS benefits)

Which would you prefer?

**Current attempt:** Plain UTF-8 with no code page commands (will likely still show gibberish)
