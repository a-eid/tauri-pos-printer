# Fixes Applied - Arabic Printing

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HTML Printing (üñ®Ô∏è With Dialog button)
**Problem:** Error: "a webview with label print-receipt already exists"
**Root Cause:** Window wasn't being closed properly between print jobs
**Fix:** 
- Generate unique window labels using timestamps
- Properly close window after printing
- Added `use tauri::Manager;` for window management

### 2. Silent GDI Printing (üöÄ Print Arabic Silent button)
**Problem:** Said "success" but nothing actually printed
**Root Cause:** Mixing RAW printer mode with GDI drawing commands
- Using `StartDocPrinterW` with `datatype = "RAW"` puts printer in RAW data mode
- But then using GDI `DrawTextW` commands which require graphics mode
- The two modes are incompatible!

**Fix:** Switch to pure GDI mode
- **Before:** `OpenPrinterW` ‚Üí `StartDocPrinterW` (RAW) ‚Üí `StartPagePrinter` ‚Üí GDI drawing (doesn't work!)
- **After:** `CreateDCW` ‚Üí `StartDocW` (GDI mode) ‚Üí `StartPage` ‚Üí GDI drawing ‚Üí `EndPage` ‚Üí `EndDoc` ‚úÖ

**Key Changes:**
```rust
// REMOVED (RAW mode):
- OpenPrinterW, ClosePrinter
- StartDocPrinterW, EndDocPrinter  
- StartPagePrinter, EndPagePrinter
- DOC_INFO_1W with datatype = "RAW"

// ADDED (GDI mode):
- CreateDCW (only)
- StartDocW, EndDoc
- StartPage, EndPage
- DOCINFOW (GDI document info)
```

## What to Expect

### ESC/POS Button (üìÑ)
- ‚úÖ Prints immediately
- ‚ùå Arabic shows as gibberish (expected - thermal printer limitation)
- Use this only for testing printer connection

### HTML Dialog Button (üñ®Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Opens print dialog
- ‚úÖ Arabic renders perfectly (Windows GDI)
- ‚úÖ Can now print multiple times without errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires user to click "Print" button
- üí° **Tip:** Set NCR 7197 as default printer for faster printing

### Silent Button (üöÄ) - RECOMMENDED
- ‚úÖ Prints immediately (no dialog!)
- ‚úÖ Arabic renders perfectly (Windows GDI)
- ‚úÖ No user interaction needed
- ‚úÖ Perfect for POS systems
- **This is the solution you want to use in production!**

## Technical Details

**Why GDI Mode Works:**
1. Creates a proper Device Context (DC) for the printer
2. Uses `StartDocW` which tells Windows "I'm sending graphics"
3. `DrawTextW` renders Arabic text with proper shaping/RTL
4. `EndPage` + `EndDoc` sends the rendered graphics to printer spooler
5. Printer receives graphics data (not text), so no encoding issues

**Why RAW Mode Failed:**
1. `StartDocPrinterW` with RAW tells Windows "I'm sending raw bytes"
2. GDI drawing commands write to DC but don't get sent to RAW stream
3. `EndPagePrinter` just closes the (empty) RAW data stream
4. Nothing actually prints!

## Testing

After the GitHub Action builds the new `.exe`:

1. Download and install the new build
2. Select your NCR 7197 printer
3. Test all three buttons:
   - ESC/POS: Should print English (Arabic gibberish is expected)
   - HTML Dialog: Should open print dialog ‚Üí click Print ‚Üí perfect Arabic
   - Silent: Should print IMMEDIATELY with perfect Arabic! üéâ

If silent printing still doesn't work, check:
- Is NCR 7197 selected in the dropdown?
- Is the printer online and ready?
- Check Windows printer queue for any errors

## Next Steps

Once confirmed working, you can:
1. Remove ESC/POS button (not useful for Arabic)
2. Hide HTML dialog button (backup option)
3. Make silent button the primary/only print button
4. Update UI to show "Printing..." state during silent print
